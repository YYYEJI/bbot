The many finely tuned parameters of the cosmos together form perhaps the greatest scientific insight and discovery ever made. And yet to the big bang theory, fine tuning is a massive anomaly, leaving those who believe in it to attempt to explain away, with extremely wild secondary assumptions, the mathematical beauty and precision of the creation. To begin with, Barrow & Tipler, in their standard treatment, The Anthropic Cosmological Principle, admit that 'there exist a number of unlikely coincidences between numbers of enormous magnitude that are, superficially, completely independent; moreover, these coincidences appear essential to the existence of carbon-based observers in the Universe,' and include the wildly unlikely combination of:- the electron to proton ratio standard deviation of 1 to 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (37 0s)- the 1-to-1 electron to proton ratio throughout the universe yields our electrically neutral universe- the electron to proton mass ratio (1 to 1,836) perfect for forming molecules- the electromagnetic and gravitational forces finely tuned for the stability of stars- the gravitational and inertial mass equivalency- the electromagnetic force constant perfect for holding electrons to nuclei- the electromagnetic force in the right ratio to the nuclear force- the strong force (which if changed by 1% would destroy all carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and heavier elements)- etc.* The Tuned Parameters of the Galaxy for the Earth include:- The Earth's position far from the Milky Way's center puts it in a galactic 'Goldilocks zone' of low radiation- The Earth's position in one of the arms of the Milky Way puts it where we can discover a vast swath of the universe* The Finely Tuned Parameters of the Solar System include:- the Moon's distance from the Earth provides tides to keep life thriving in our oceans, and thus, worldwide- the Moon's mass helps stabilize the Earth's tilt on its axis, which provides for the diversity of alternating seasons- the Moon's nearly circular orbit (eccentricity ~ 0.05) makes it's influence extraordinarily reliable- the Moon is 1/400th the size of the Sun, and at 1/400th its distance, enables educational perfect eclipses- Earth's orbit is nearly circular (eccentricity ~ 0.02) around the Sun providing a stability in a range of vital factors- Earth's orbit has a low inclination keeping it's temperatures within a range permitting diverse ecosystems- Earth's axial tilt is within a range that helps to stabilize our planet's climate- Earth's distance from the Sun provides for a great quantity of life and climate-sustaining liquid water- the Sun's uniquely stable energy output: Smithsonian; Astronomy;  Faulkner 2013;  New Scientist;  Am Scientist- the Sun's mass and size permit the perfect orbital characteristics for our biosphere without destructive tides- the Sun's luminosity and temperature are just right to provide for Earth's extraordinary range of ecosystems- the Sun's color is tuned for maximum benefit for the photosynthesis of our plant life, as is its mass- the Sun's low 'metallicity' prevents the destruction of life on Earth- etc.* The Finely Tuned Parameters of the Earth include:- the Earth's surface gravity strength preventing the atmosphere from losing water to space too rapidly- the Earth's just-right ozone layer filters out ultraviolet radiation and helps mitigate temperature swings- the Earth's spin rate on its axis provides for a range of day and nighttime temperatures to allow life to thrive- the atmosphere's composition (20% oxygen, etc.) provides for life's high energy requirements- if Earth's oxygen content were higher, forest fires would worsen; at 30%-40% the atmosphere could ignite- the atmosphere's pressure enables our lungs to function and water to evaporate at an optimal rate to support life- the atmosphere's transparency to allow an optimal range of life-giving solar radiation to reach the surface- the unique abilities of the carbon atom enables carbon-based lifeforms- the atmosphere's capacity to hold water vapor providing for stable temperature and rainfall ranges- life-giving photosynthesis dependence on quantum physics as reported in the journal PNAS- no species metabolizes cellulose, thus preventing runaway consumption of all plant life- the water molecule's astounding robustness results from finely balanced quantum effects. As reported by New Scientist, 'Water's life-giving properties exist on a knife-edge. It turns out that life as we know it relies on a fortuitous, but incredibly delicate, balance of quantum forces. ... We are used to the idea that the cosmos' physical constraints are fine-tuned for life. Now it seems water's quantum forces can be added to this 'just right' list.'- water is an unrivaled solvent; its low viscosity permits the tiniest blood vessels; its high specific heat stabilizes biosphere temperatures; its low thermal conductivity as a solid insulates frozen-over lakes and as a liquid its high conductivity lets organisms distribute heat; its an efficient lubricant; is only mildly reactive; has an anomalous (fish-saving) expansion when it freezes; its high vapor tension keeps moisture in the atmosphere; and it tastes great too!- the phenomenally harmonious water cycle- water permits the passage of the Sun's life-giving radiation to depths of 500 meters- the carbon atom's astounding capabilities. As Cambridge astronomer Fred Hoyle wrote: 'Some super-calculating intellect must have designed the properties of the carbon atom, otherwise the chance of my finding such an atom through the blind forces of nature would be utterly minuscule. A common sense interpretation of the facts suggests that a superintellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as with chemistry and biology, and that there are no blind forces worth speaking about in nature. The numbers one calculates from the facts seem to me so overwhelming as to put this conclusion almost beyond question.'- etc., etc., etc.번역 - fingerofthomas출처 - YouTube
