단백질과 DNA의 생성 (Proteins and DNA production)1) 단백질 (Proteins)살아있는 생물체는 많은 단백질들로 구성되어 있다. 단백질은 아미노산의 긴 사슬이다. 1930년대 이후, 만약 산소가 존재한다면, 아미노산은 연결될 수 없다는 것을 알게 되었다. 다시 말하면, 만약 대기에 산소가 존재한다면, 단백질들은 우연한 화학반응으로 만들어질 수 없다는 것이다. 그러나 육지나 바다 밑의 지구 암석의 화학 조성을 조사한 결과, 지구는 가장 초기의 화석들이 형성되기 이전부터 산소를 가지고 있었음을 보여주고 있다.1 초기에도, 태양 방사선은 수증기를 수소와 산소로 깨뜨렸을 것이다. 가장 가벼운 화학원소인 수소 일부는 바깥 우주로 빠져나가면서 남은 산소를 남겨두었을 수도 있다.2단백질을 형성하기 위해서, 아미노산들이 고도로 농축되어야만 한다. 그러나 초기 대양과 대기는 아미노산들을 희석하였을 것이다. 그래서 그들 사이에 필요한 충돌은 극히 드물었을 것이다. 게다가, 아미노산들은 자연적으로 단백질을 형성하도록 연결되어질 수 없다. 대신 단백질들은 아미노산으로 깨어지는 경향이 있다.3 더군다나, 단백질들을 형성하는데 사용되었다고 제시된 에너지의 근원들(지열, 전기력, 태양복사선)은 단백질을 형성하는 것보다 수천 배 빠르게 파괴를 일으킨다.4 생명체가 어떻게 지구에서 시작되었는지에 대한 많은 연구들은 1)그러한 노력의 헛됨(futility) 2)가장 간단한 생물체라도 엄청나게 복잡함5 3)생명체가 있기 전에 무한한 지성(intelligence)이 필요함, 등을 알게 해주었다.      2) DNA의 생성 (DNA Production)DNA는 적어도 이미 존재하는 75 개의 단백질들이 없이는 기능을 할 수 없다.6 그러나 단백질들은 DNA의 지시에 의해서만 만들어진다.7 하나는 다른 하나를 필요로 하기 때문에, 하나의 기원에 대한 만족한 설명은 또 다른 것의 기원에 대해 설명하여야만 한다.8 이 제조 시스템의 구성물질들은 동시에 존재해야만 하는 것이다. 이것은 창조를 의미한다.  *한국창조과학회 자료실/진화론/화학진화에 있는 많은 자료들을 참조하세요    http://www.kacr.or.kr/library/listview.asp?category=I05 References and Notes1. An authoritative study concluded that the early biosphere contained oxygen before the earliest fossils (bacteria) formed. Iron oxides were found that 'imply a source of oxygen enough to convert into insoluble ferric material the ferrous solutions that must have first formed the flat, continuous horizontal layers that can in some sites be traced over hundreds of kilometers.” Philip Morrison, 'Earth’s Earliest Biosphere,” Scientific American, Vol. 250, April 1984, pp. 30?31.* Charles F. Davidson, 'Geochemical Aspects of Atmospheric Evolution,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Vol. 53, 15 June 1965, pp. 1194?1205.* Steven A. Austin, 'Did the Early Earth Have a Reducing Atmosphere?” ICR Impact, No. 109, July 1982.* 'In general, we find no evidence in the sedimentary distributions of carbon, sulfur, uranium, or iron, that an oxygen-free atmosphere has existed at any time during the span of geological history recorded in well-preserved sedimentary rocks.” Erich Dimroth and Michael M. Kimberley, 'Precambrian Atmospheric Oxygen: Evidence in the Sedimentary Distributions of Carbon, Sulfur, Uranium, and Iron,” Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, Vol. 13, No. 9, September 1976, p. 1161.*'What is the evidence for a primitive methane-ammonia atmosphere on earth? The answer is that there is no evidence for it, but much against it.” [emphasis in original] Philip H.

'I believe this [the overwhelming tendency for chemical reactions to move in the direction opposite to that required for the evolution of life] to be the most stubborn problem that confronts us - the weakest link at present in our argument [for the origin of life]. George Wald, 'The Origin of Life,” p. 50.4.'The conclusion from these arguments presents the most serious obstacle, if indeed it is not fatal, to the theory of spontaneous generation. First, thermodynamic calculations predict vanishingly small concentrations of even the simplest organic compounds. Secondly, the reactions that are invoked to synthesize such compounds are seen to be much more effective in decomposing them.” D. E. Hull, 'Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Spontaneous Generation,” Nature, Vol. 186, 28 May 1960, p. 694.* Pitman, p. 140.* Duane T. Gish, Speculations and Experiments Related to Theories on the Origin of Life, ICR Technical Monograph, No. 1 (El Cajon, California: Institute for Creation Research, 1972).5. Robert Shapiro, Origins (New York: Bantam Books, 1986).* The experiments by Harold Urey and Stanley Miller are often mentioned as showing that the 'building blocks of life” can be produced in the laboratory. Not mentioned in these misleading claims are:  ·These 'building blocks” are merely the simpler amino acids. The most complex amino acids have never been produced in the laboratory.  ·Most products of these chemical reactions are poisonous to life.  ·Amino acids are as far from a living cell as bricks are from the Empire State Building.  ·Half the amino acids produced have the wrong handedness.  (See 'Handedness: Left and Right' on page 15.)  ·Urey and Miller’s experimental apparatus contained components, such as a trap, that do not exist in nature. (A trap quickly removes chemical products from the destructive energy sources that make the products.)All of the above show why intelligence and design are necessary to produce even the simplest components of life.*'The story of the slow paralysis of research on life’s origin is quite interesting, but space precludes its retelling here. Suffice it to say that at present the field of origin of life studies has dissolved into a cacophony of conflicting models, each unconvincing, seriously incomplete, and incompatible with competing models. In private even most evolutionary biologists will admit that science has no explanation for the beginning of life.”  Behe, 'Molecular Machines,” p. 30.6. Ribosomes, complex structures that assemble proteins, have about 55 different proteins. More than 20 additional proteins are required to attach the 20 standard types of amino acids to transfer RNA. DNA binding proteins and other proteins, specifically enzymes, also participate in the process.7. Richard E. Dickerson, 'Chemical Evolution and the Origin of Life,” Scientific American, Vol. 239, September 1978, p. 73.*'The amino acids must link together to form proteins, and the other chemicals must join up to make nucleic acids, including the vital DNA. The seemingly insurmountable obstacle is the way the two reactions are inseparably linked?one can’t happen without the other. Proteins depend on DNA for their formation. But DNA cannot form without pre-existing protein.”  Hitching, p. 66.8.'The origin of the genetic code presents formidable unsolved problems. The coded information in the nucleotide sequence is meaningless without the translation machinery, but the specification for this machinery is itself coded in the DNA. Thus without the machinery the information is meaningless, but without the coded information the machinery cannot be produced! This presents a paradox of the ‘chicken and egg’ variety, and attempts to solve it have so far been sterile.” John C. Walton, (Lecturer in Chemistry, University of St. Andrews, Fife, Scotland), 'Organization and the Origin of Life,” Origins, Vol. 4, No. 1, 1977, pp. 30-31.*'Genes and enzymes are linked together in a living cell?two interlocked systems, each supporting the other. It is difficult to see how either could manage alone. Yet if we are to avoid invoking either a Creator or a very large improbability, we must accept that one occurred before the other in the origin of life. But which one was it? We are left with the ancient riddle: Which came first, the chicken or the egg?” Shapiro, p. 135.번역 - 미디어위원회링크 - http://www.creationscience.com/ 출처 - CSC구분 - 3옛 주소 - http://www.kacr.or.kr/library/itemview.asp?no=588참고 : 4509|4466|4333|4061|3742|3075|2621|2533|4582|4598|4657|4806|4821|4879|5305|5165|5167|5318|5411
